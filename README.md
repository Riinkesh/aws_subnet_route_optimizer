# This AWS Lambda function inspects the route tables of a specified VPC in your AWS account and identifies relationships between destination CIDR blocks for each route targetâ€”specifically, whether any CIDR is a subnet of another within the same target and route table.

# Features
Fetches all route tables associated with a given VPC.

Groups routes by route table and target (e.g., Gateway, NAT, Transit Gateway, etc.).

Analyzes CIDR blocks to detect subnet relationships.

Returns subnet relationship findings as a structured response.

# Use Case
This function is particularly useful for auditing and validating routing configurations in VPCs. It helps identify overlapping or nested routes that may lead to unexpected network behavior.

# Usage
# Event Input
The Lambda function expects an event with the following parameters:
"vpc_id": "vpc-xxxxxxxx",
  "region": "us-east-1" // optional, defaults to 'us-east-1'

  "statusCode": 200,
  "body": {
    "subnet_relationships": [
      "10.0.1.0/24 is a subnet of 10.0.0.0/16 (target: igw-abc123, route table: rtb-xyz789)"
    ]
  }
# Error Response

  "statusCode": 400,
  "body": "Missing required parameter: vpc_id"

# Deployment
This function is written in Python and designed for use as an AWS Lambda. You can deploy it using AWS SAM, CloudFormation, or directly through the AWS Console.
